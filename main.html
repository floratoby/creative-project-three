  <h2>Trial Background</h2>
  <p>
    The plaintiff, <strong>Iam Nothavin Dis</strong>, is concerned about how the Fairfax County
    Police Department is using a new facial recognition system, formally known as
    ICU short for Impression Capturing Unit. Furthermore Dis is distressed about how the
    department is storing and using the private data obtained from the ICU scans. Dis alleges
    that Fairfax County Police Department uses ICU passively on passersby and stores private data
    gathered through it for an extended period of time without any probable cause or advance notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    ICU uses facial images of subjects captured from officers’ body-cams and patrol
    vehicle cams to search for their identity and criminal background if any. ICU is a
    very advanced A.I based system which is able to ID people with a whopping 98% accuracy.
    To use ICU, the officers need to click on the face of the subject from the live feed of
    the patrol car on the screen or a recording and then click on run facial scan. The ICU
    grants officers private information and criminal records of the subjects within a matter of seconds.
    Each ICU scan is logged for record keeping. Everytime an ICU scan is requested, the system warns
    its user that unlawful use of this software constitutes an invasion of privacy which is prosecutable by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to prove the unlawful use of ICU, Iam made two casual encounters with on-duty cops.
    He believes that in these casual encounters, there was no reason for the cops to scan him
    using the ICU. Iam waited for two months before submitting a request to the department to
    find out if his name ever came up as a result of ICU scan under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act
    (FOIA). His name, Iam Nothaving Dis, came up two times.
  </p>
  <p>
    The plaintiff, Iam Nothaving Dis, is suing the Fairfax County Police Department
    for violating Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act, Virginia Code 2.2-3800 et seq (“Data Act”).
  </p>
  <p>
    The plaintiff must prove that the police department is passively running ICU scans on subjects
    without a probable cause or advance notice. Furthermore, the FCPD is storing the private data acquired using the ICU scan for
    an extended period of time and not handling it according to the standards declared in the Data Act.
  </p>

  <h2>Basis for Case and Legal Elements</h2>

  <p>
    The plaintiff is suing the police department for using ICU, A.I. based facial recognition system, which
    searched private data of the plaintiff without any probable cause. For the plaintiff’s cause of action to be proven,
    they must prove that information was being collected, the police did not have probable cause to collect that information,
    the data was not secured properly and the data that was collected was an invasion of the plaintiff's privacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Plaintiff must prove that his rights under the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act,
    Virginia Code 2.2-3800 et seq (“Data Act”) were violated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The FCPD must prove that the data collection from the ICU scans is in complete accordance with the privacy laws.
    Furthermore, the private information of the plaintiff was collected as a result of a probable cause given the circumstances.
    Lastly, the data is collected securely and handled with care as per the state mandated guidelines.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make a strong case in the court, the plaintiff must demonstrate the following:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Demonstrate that the officers had no probable cause to use ICU on the plaintiff.</li>
    <li>The plaintiff must display to the court that his privacy was invaded as a result of the ICU scan.</li>
    <li>The information obtained by running the facial recognition was not secured properly stored by the FCPD for an extended period of time.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    To make a strong case in the court, the defence must demonstrate the following:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Demonstrate that the officers had a probable cause in scanning Iam with ICU.</li>
    <li>The use of ICU on the plaintiff did not invade plaintiff’s privacy. </li>
    <li>The information obtained by ICU scan was stored by the FCPD for a reasonable amount of time which is standard for all the facial recognition runs. </li>
  </ol>

  <h1 style="width: 40%;">III. Trial Analysis</h1>
  <h2>Plaintiff's Argument</h2>
  <p>
    The plaintiff, Iam Nothaving Dis, must prove in court that the police officers who took his identification without his permission through the use of the body cam had no probable cause to do so. He must also prove that the police officers had no
    probable cause or right to post his information up in a public database accessible for all to see. The plaintiff can prove his side of the case by citing details from the Data Act and by proving that at the time he did not pose a threat to the
    police officers in any way for them to take his information from the body cams.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two witnesses in the case that would help Iam. Iam’s key witness in this case is going to be John Connor from the FCPD, an AI/Database developer. Connor has noticed that the facial recognition data stored in the database is accessible
    to anyone and everyone. He has also noticed people have come to the police department and requested personal information about strangers without good reasons. John Connor can help attest to the fact that the database and the security around the
    data is not very strict. Another witness who can help Iam is Ethan IcLean, a GentleWash employee who has had a very similar experience as Iam. Ethan's father, a police officer, found Ethan’s information on the Police Department’s database. Ethan
    later realized that one of the police officers who got his patrol car cleaned there ran him using the facial recognition system without his permission. These two witnesses would provide Iam with a strong defense in court. Along with the
    witnesses, there are also several past cases that would help with Iam’s current case.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of Plasters v. Commonwealth, the police officer used a computer system to look up information about individuals when she had no business doing that. The court found her guilty of computer invasion of privacy. In this case, the
    plaintiff accessed private information about an individual using a computer terminal. This case would help Iam with establishing that the police officers had no authority to put his information up on a public database that would be accessible to
    all, as doing so was a clear invasion of privacy. It can also be argued that if the police officers had no authority to access his information, then the ordinary citizen would have no jurisdiction. The legal element here involves invasion of
    privacy. The case Plasters v. Commonwealth would also help set a precedent that the police officers would need probable cause to look up and find personal information on people so that they aren’t allowed to freely look for sensitive information
    without a plausible reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of Thomas v. Payne, the plaintiff accused an officer of running a background check on him and then releasing that information to other officers. The plaintiff lost his job, was humiliated and ridiculed as a result of the officer’s
    action. The defendants raised a “plea in bar” defense, which if proven true, would block the plaintiff’s claim from going forward. The pleas in bar were overruled for the intentional act of running a background check by the officer. This case
    falls under the legal element of having prior knowledge that his information was being collected. In Iam’s case, he had no idea that his information was being collected via the A.I system. The case of Thomas v. Payne would help establish that Iam
    had a right to know his information was going to be taken by the police officers and released onto a public database. The case would also help set a precedent that police officers may not share sensitive, personal information about individuals
    publicly without probable cause. In this case, it publicly involved the database.
  </p>
  <h2>Defendant's Argument</h2>
  <p>
    The defendant, the Fairfax County Police Department, must display in court that the police officers had probable cause when they collected Iam’s information using the facial recognition system. The Fairfax County Police Department can defeat the
    plaintiff's case by showing testimony and previous cases from different sources that have helped prove the police had probable cause when collecting Iam’s facial recognition information thereby making their use of the AI not an infringement of
    the Data Act.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two witnesses in the case that can attest to the probable cause of the police officers. The key witness for the police department is Officer Gordon, who was the active officer on the scene during the incident in question. He was getting
    coffee with his partner, when they noticed a suspicious person walking out of Starbucks. They believed they saw something that resembled a gun protruding from the pocket of the plaintiff. This led to his partner to run the facial recognition
    system. Officer Gordon’s testimony shows evidence of probable cause to run Iam’s face. The other witness that could help defeat the plaintiff's case by attesting to the probable cause is John Smith. John Smith is an owner of Dunkin Donuts. He
    noticed the plaintiff approaching his store with an unsteady gait while also having some kind of bulge in his pocket. John Smith’s testimony could be used to show the suspicious nature of the plaintiff and that cops may have had probable cause
    when they ran facial recognition on the plaintiff.
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple supporting cases can help the defense in defeating the plaintiff. In the case of Whitaker v. Commonwealth, the plaintiff argued that the police did not have probable cause to detain him. The courts denied the claim because of how he was
    acting and the location's high crime rate. This case, with support from the testimony of officer Gordan and John smith, supports the claim that the defendant had probable cause. In Foltz v. Commonwealth, the officers placed a GPS device to gain
    information about the plaintiff’s whereabouts. The officers had good reasons to do so because they believed that he was planning a crime, as well as the information gained from the GPS, was public information the police could have obtained
    otherwise. This case could show that probable cause was unneeded in the use of facial recognition scanning because the defense could argue the scanner is using only public information that could be obtained by the police.. In Commonwealth v.
    Spence, the court reversed the judgment in suppressing the defendant’s evidence. The court believed the officer had reasonable suspicion that a crime was about to be committed. The officer was found justified in detaining the defendant to verify
    if his suspicions about any criminal activity were valid. This case shows there is probable cause provided that there is enough suspicious activity to warrant it. This case could help defeat the plaintiffs' argument that there was no probable
    cause.
  </p>

  <h2>Case Balance</h2>
  <p>
    Based on the witness testimonies, the relevant and supporting cases that we have accumulated, we can say that the case is reasonably balanced on both sides. The plaintiff’s side is balanced because there is evidence to support that the
    information might have been obtained without probable cause or prior knowledge. The evidence that is used to weaken the probable cause claim can be obtained through cross examining the defense witnesses. The plaintiff also has evidence from his
    witnesses to support that FCPD was not properly storing the scanned information. This evidence is obtainable by examining Ethan and John.
  </p>
  <p>
    The defence’s side is balanced because the defence has evidence to support that the police had probable cause in running the facial recognition. The probable cause is shown through the testimonies of both John Smith and Officer Gordon. Both
    parties show evidence of suspicious activity from the plaintiff. The testimony from John Smith and Officer Gordon, along with the cases that back up the claims showing probable cause, act as a strong defence to defeating the plaintiff’s case.
    Another way the defence is balanced is through the use of cross-examining the plaintiff’s key witness, John Conner. John Conner’s secret information is that he never followed up on his complaint so there is a chance the FCPD never received it.
    The FCPD can argue that they never received the complaint, so they were unaware of the database security flaw. This will help defeat the plaintiff’s argument that the FCPD did not secure the facial information. The FCPD can also use John Conner’s
    testimony to show Iam’s information was never insecure. John Conner testimony never actually specifies whose information was being given out.
