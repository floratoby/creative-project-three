  <h2>James W. Gordon</h2>
  <p>
    I am a 56 year old white man. I am avid golfer. I am married and have 2 children with my current wife and 4 children from
    my prior 2 wives. I have been with the FCPD for the past few months. I previously served in the New York Police Department
    for 20 years. I have received many awards in my career. I have been shot twice in his career but lived to brag about the
    incidents to my friends and family. I love talking to my colleagues about current events and my political views. I pride
    myself in my knowledge of human behavior and body language which I have gained over the years that I have served in the
    department.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>(This following testimony is about the first incident for which the cops scanned Iam using the facial recognition software)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Officer James W. Gordon is the key witness in this case. According to him, the accounts of the incidents are as follows.
    Officer W. Gordon and his partner (who ran the facial recognition software) were in a patrol car parked outside Starbucks
    in the Main Street Marketplace. Both officers had just gotten their coffee, and were sitting in the car and discussing something.
    Then Officer Gordon recalls that at approximately 4 PM on January 7th, 2020, he saw an individual coming out of Starbucks, with something sharp protruding from his left jacket pocket walking as fast as he could towards his car. As the individual
    passed the patrol car, it seemed as though he was hiding something in his jacket pocket which appeared to us as a gun. The individual made a quick eye contact and then proceeded to quickly walk towards his car. My partner at this point decided
    that he had enough cause to run his face using the facial recognition system.

  <h2 style="text-decoration: none; text-indent: 40px; font-size: 20px;">Secret Information:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>When serving in the New York Police Department he had been reprimanded a few times by the department for
      running people’s license plate numbers and searching cars without proper authorization. In his defense,
      he says that if the overall goal is safety of the community, “what difference does it make if I search
      someone without proper authorization if no one is getting hurt.” In a choice between safety versus privacy,
      he could care less about privacy. He believes that privacy only makes sense if you have safety.
      He was removed from the NYPD for invading someone’s privacy using a computer. </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 style="text-decoration: none; text-indent: 40px; font-size: 20px;">Pro-plaintiff Knowledge:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>His stance on privacy vs safety can weaken his testimony/accounts of the incident. </li>
    <li>The reason for his prior removal as an officer for NYPD will further weaken his testimony/accounts of the incidents.</li>
    <li>His prior record with NYPD will be damning evidence against the defense. </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 style="text-decoration: none; text-indent: 40px; font-size: 20px;">Pro-defendant Knowledge:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>His accounts of the incidents are backed by the video feed of the incident taken from the patrol car.</li>
    <li>The officer who ran Iam using facial recognition is in complete agreement with Officer Gordon’s account.
      There’s no discrepancy between both their accounts. </li>
